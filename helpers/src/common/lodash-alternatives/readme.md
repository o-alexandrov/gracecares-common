# Lodash alternatives

In this directory, you can find alternative implementations of `lodash` functions that are easier to read, smaller, and faster.

Typically, we bring such alternatives from:

- GitHub's repo [you-dont-need/You-Dont-Need-Lodash-Underscore](https://github.com/you-dont-need/You-Dont-Need-Lodash-Underscore)
- Nice-looking website [You Might Not Need Lodash](https://youmightnotneed.com/lodash)
